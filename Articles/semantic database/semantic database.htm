<p>Semantic Database - Concepts, Design, Implementation</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<h3>Semantics</h3>
<p>Semantics is an emerging &quot;space&quot; of research and development in 
information 
science.&nbsp; You have most likely heard of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a> and perhaps 
have looked at (or are already working with) technologies such as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Resource 
Description Format</a> (RDF) and/or the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language">Web Ontology 
Language</a> (OWL).&nbsp; </p>
<p>If not, you are most likely wondering, what is the point of all of this?&nbsp; 
A good description of why semantics is important comes from the
<a href="http://www.schema.org/">schema.org</a>:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in 
databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to 
recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search 
engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data.&quot;</i></p>
<p>In other words, by exposing the semantics of the data, machines can then 
utilize the information in more interesting ways than just storing it or 
displaying it.&nbsp; A classic example is a website that contains a phone 
number.&nbsp; If the phone number is has a semantic tag, then your smart phone 
can easily offer it up as number to dial.&nbsp; Contrast this with the hoops an 
application has to go through to scan a page and find text that matches any 
number of styles of presenting a phone number, validating that it is actually a 
number rather than a math expression that looks like &quot;619-555-1212&quot;, etc.</p>
<h3>Structured Data</h3>
<p>In the above quote, you'll notice the phrase &quot;<i>recover the original 
structured data.</i>&quot;&nbsp; This implies that the data has structure -- it's not 
just a field, but the fields mean something and can have sub-structures -- in 
other words, the structured data is a tree.</p>
<p>Here's a couple examples:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="latlon.png" width="188" height="244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="sphone.png" width="432" height="169" style="margin-bottom:40px"></p>
<h3>Ontology</h3>
<p>While in the abstract, &quot;ontology&quot; means &quot;the branch of metaphysics dealing 
with the nature of being,&quot; in information science:</p>
<p><i>&quot;An ontology is defined as a formal, explicit specification of a shared 
conceptualization. It provides a common vocabulary to denote the types, 
properties and interrelationships of concepts in a domain.&quot; </i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">- Ontology 
(information science)</a></p>
<p>And notice:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and 
are used in ...the <u>Semantic Web</u>...&quot;</i></p>
<p>Semantics are useful for understanding the structure of a &quot;thing&quot;, however we 
need ontologies to relate things with other things.&nbsp; One would expect that 
a semantic database be relational -- it would be able to relate structured data 
into ontologies using &quot;semantic relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is an example instance of the <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">
Friend of a Friend</a> ontology (from the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-swbp-skos-core-guide-20051102/">W3C SKOS 
Core Guide</a>):</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="foaf.png" width="613" height="506"></p>
<p>The SKOS Core Vocabulary defines two properties of a semantic relationship:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The relationship between the two structures defines one as being 
	&quot;broader&quot; or &quot;narrower&quot; with relation to the other</li>
	<li>An associative relationship, in which the two structures are &quot;related&quot; 
</li>
</ol>
<p>We again see two concepts emerging:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The relationship between data structures is itself structural (trees)</li>
<li>A structural can be associated with another structure (relational)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Graph Databases</h3>
<p>If you haven't heard, graph databases are all the rage at the moment, one of 
the most popular being <a href="http://www.neo4j.org">Neo4j</a>.&nbsp; From 
their website:</p>
<p><i>&quot;A graph database stores data in a graph, the most generic of data 
structures, capable of elegantly representing any kind of data in a highly 
accessible way.&quot;</i></p>
<p>It is very important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a graph 
database with regards to a semantic database.&nbsp; There is a lot of guidance 
that a graph database can give on understanding the issues of mapping 
ontologies.&nbsp; Ironically though, a graph database does very poorly with 
regards the capturing semantic structure, as will be revealed in the following 
discussion.</p>
<h4>What is a Graph?</h4>
<p>From Neo4j's website:</p>
<p><i>&quot;...a graph is just a collection of vertices and edges—or, in less 
intimidating language,a set of nodes and the relationships that connect them. 
Graphs represent entities as nodes and the ways in which those entities relate 
to the world as relationships.&quot; -</i> Robinson, Ian, &amp; Webber, Jim, &amp; Eifrem, 
Emil (2013). <i>Graph Databases.</i> O'Reilly, pg 1 (free download
<a href="http://www.graphdatabases.com/">here</a>.)</p>
<h4>Graph Database vs. Relational Database</h4>
<p>Importantly, with regards to traditional relational databases:</p>
<p><i>&quot;...relational databases were initially designed to codify paper forms and 
tabular structures—something they do exceedingly well—they struggle when 
attempting to model the ad hoc, exceptional relationships that crop up in the 
real world. Ironically, relational databases deal poorly with relationships.&nbsp; 
Relationships do exist in the vernacular of relational databases, but only as a 
means of joining tables. In our discussion of connected data in the previous 
chapter, we mentioned we often need to disambiguate the semantics of the 
relationships that connect entities, as well as qualify their weight or 
strength. Relational relations do nothing of the sort.&quot; </i>- (ibid, pg 11)</p>
<p>And here is a very important point:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Relationships are first-class citizens of the graph data model, unlike 
other database management systems, which require us to infer connections between 
entities using contrived properties such as foreign keys, or out-of-band 
processing like map-reduce. By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and 
relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable us to build 
arbitrarily sophisticated models that map closely to our problem domain. The 
resulting models are simpler and at the same time more expressive than those 
produced using traditional relational databases and the other NOSQL stores.&quot;</i> 
- (ibid, pg 6)</p>
<p>So there is actually a third leg to the semantic database concept.&nbsp; We 
previously identified:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Semantic structure - the structure of a particular &quot;thing&quot;</li>
	<li>Ontology - the structure of semantic structures</li>
</ol>
<p>We now add a third aspect:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explicit connection meaning</p>

<p>In other words, the connections between semantic structures that comprise the 
ontology themselves have meaning.</p>
<h4>Loss of Semantic Structure</h4>
<p>Because a graph database focuses on the ontology of information, it has no 
concept of the actual structures that define the properties of a node.&nbsp; 
This is a result of the concept of &quot;facts&quot;:&nbsp; <i>&quot;When two or more domain 
entities interact for a period of time, a fact emerges. We represent these facts 
as separate nodes, with connections to each of the entities engaged in that 
fact.&quot;</i> - (ibid, pg 66)</p>
<p>We can see this in the examples given for creating a graph database.&nbsp; 
From pg 41:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphdb1.png" width="337" height="137"></p>
<p>We have &quot;fact&quot; nodes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>William Shakespeare</li>
<li>The Tempest</li>
	<li>Juilias Ceasar</li>
</ul>
<p>This information lacks semantic context, for example indicating that 
&quot;William Shakespeare&quot; is a playwright or that &quot;The Tempest&quot; is a play.&nbsp; 
Interestingly, this semantic information becomes an arbitrary label in the
<a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/cypher-query-lang.html">Cypher</a> query 
fragment <code>bard=node:author(lastname='Shakespeare')</code>.&nbsp; From the 
query we can determine that William Shakespeare is a bard, however, this 
information is completely lost in the graph database!&nbsp; To put it another 
way, if we follow the &quot;fact&quot; best practice, it becomes impossible to query a 
graph database for data by specifying a semantic context.&nbsp; I cannot ask the 
graph database &quot;show me all the people that are bards&quot; unless I explicitly 
create a node called &quot;bard&quot; with a relationship to William Shakespeare.&nbsp; 
This problem stems partially from the fact that a graph database represents a 
specific domain: <i>&quot;By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and 
relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable us to build 
arbitrarily sophisticated models that map closely to our problem domain.&quot;</i> - 
(ibid, pg 6).&nbsp; At best, we can say a node with properties &quot;firstname&quot; and &quot;lastname&quot; 
represents a &quot;person&quot;, but we can say nothing else about that person, such as 
distinguishing the person from the playwright, the producer, or the actor, <i>
except</i> through a relationship with another node, where the relationship 
provides further semantic meaning, such as &quot;wrote_play&quot;, or &quot;produced_play&quot; or &quot;acted_in&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a graph database typically views semantics (the data structure) as a 
second class citizen, as, for example:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Use node properties to represent entity attributes, plus any necessary 
entity metadata, such as timestamps, version numbers, etc.&quot; -</i> Robinson, Ian, 
&amp; Webber, Jim, &amp; Eifrem, Emil (2013). <i>Graph Databases.</i> O'Reilly, pg 65 
(free download <a href="http://www.graphdatabases.com/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The concern here is that the graph database is emphasizing the ontology, 
leaving the semantic structure to be defined as node properties.</p>
<h3>Semantic Database</h3>
<p>In the above discussion, we come to several important observations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>An ontology emphases the relationship of entities rather than defining 
	the entity structure.</li>
	<li>Semantics emphasizes the structure but not the relationships between 
	structures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, with regards to current database options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Graph databases describe ontologies, not semantics.</li>
	<li>Relational databases describe relationships rather poorly (and semantic 
	structures not at all).</li>
	<li>NoSQL database don't describe relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article looks at a specific design of a semantic database and its 
initial implementation.&nbsp; A semantic database brings together the loosely 
coupled fields of graph databases, ontology engineering, and semantics.</p>

<li><b>The world is connected.</b> The value in computing these days is no 
longer about automating business processes (this was the dominant use case when 
the relational database was born). Today’s problems center around understanding 
the real world in all its connected and dynamic glory. The world is a graph: 
might as well embrace it.</li>
<li><b>Change happens fast.</b> The world moves a lot faster than it did 20 
years ago. Back then, it didn’t matter if it took months and years to design and 
write systems. Today the timescale is months. Putting connected data into a 
relational database is hard. And getting it out is even harder. By putting your 
graph data into a graph database, the modeling time and development time are 
both drastically reduced, and it’s much easier to change the model once the 
system has been built.</li>
