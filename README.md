Higher Order Programming Environment
=========

What is the Higher Order Programming Environment?

Hope is a "surface" enabling end-users to create user-specific applications from "receptor" components.

Applications have a limited surface area of functionality (behavior.)  The user can only extend behavior by going outside of the application, either to the cloud or another desktop application.

Conversely, receptors provide specific behaviors with which other receptors interact.  By "dropping" a customized configuration of receptors onto the surface, the end-user can create a behavior tailored specifically to his/her needs.
